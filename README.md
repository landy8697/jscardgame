## JavaScript Card Game

For this project, you're going to create a card game in JavaScript. It can be any card game you want, but keep in mind that unless you create a computer player it will be difficult to have a multiplayer game since all players will be able to see each hand. 

**Requirements**
* Must be playable with the mouse - click, drag, whatever. `addEventListener` is a good place to start looking for interacting with elements on the screen.
* Must include images. You can find card images only, or you can use the [DeckOfCards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) that we used last semester. It can handle the deck and has images available. 
* It must be winnable / loseable, either each individual hand or through multiple draws.
